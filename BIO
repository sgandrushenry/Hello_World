About Your Student Mentor
A little bit about me, so you don't need to Google…  Samantha (“Sam”) Andrus-Henry is all, but dissertation in Rhetoric, Technology, and Technical Communication from the Humanities Department of Michigan Technological University (Geeks Rule!!), which is clear up in the UP (Upper Peninsula) of Michigan (it’s cold up thar!!).  I got my first Masters in English (Rhetoric, Composition, and Technology) from Northern Arizona University (Go, LumberJacks!!) in Flagstaff, Arizona.  I received my second Master’s degree here at WGU in Instructional Design (Woot! Woot! Night Owls!!). And, my undergraduate work was done at Weber State University (Great, Great, Great!!!) in History with minors in English and Athletic Coaching. A technophile all my life, I was one of the first instructors to begin teaching English courses that included technology, code, and used a variety of mediums from online, camera-based, and social media.  I have been with WGU for 5 years.  As a single mother, my crowning achievement will be raising my five children.  I enjoy yoga, eating chocolate, peanut-butter ice cream, and cooking good food with good friends and family while grooving to old Motown.  I am a Colorado native (Orange Crush all the way!!), but presently call Tooele, Utah home (Hurrah!!! Buffs, Stallions, and Cowboys) where I am also an adjunct instructor for Utah State University (Fear the Herd---Go Aggies!!!).
